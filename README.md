# modern-data-engineering

This repository documents my hands-on learning and practice across
modern data engineering concepts, tools, and patterns, with a focus on
production-ready thinking and real-world tradeoffs.

The work here emphasizes:
- Correctness and data grain awareness
- Scalable SQL and analytics engineering
- Data modeling and transformations (dbt)
- Distributed processing and orchestration
- Infrastructure as Code and cloud fundamentals
- Data governance, security, and cost optimization

The repository evolves over time as new topics and projects are added.
